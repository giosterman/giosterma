		<p>My name is Giovanna, and I am is a third-year Journalism + Design student at The New School, with a minor in Fashion Communications. I'm originally from Los Angeles, California, which I only miss for the beaches and In N Out.</p>

		<p>Aside from being a full-time student, I have has been running my own fashion blog, The Unkempt, for over four years. The Unkempt reflects my vintage, androgynous style on a broke college student budget, and has steadily grown to reach a worldwide audience of over 74,000 readers. I also regularly write freelance for digital publications, and I have covered events through Los Angeles and New York Fashion Week as a social media influencer.</p>

		<p>When I'm not blogging or writing, I can usually be found exploring art museums, spending too much money on iced coffee, or searching for Jalape√±o-Cheddar Cheetos. </p>
